This project analyzes loan risk performance with the objective of distinguishing performing and non-performing loans within a lending portfolio. The analysis examines borrower demographics, loan characteristics, income attributes, credit history, and repayment behavior to identify the key drivers of default and timely repayment. Insights from this study support improved risk segmentation, early-warning detection, and data-driven credit decision frameworks.
